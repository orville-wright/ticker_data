# Pseudocode: FeatureEngineer.calculate_macd

This document outlines the detailed, language-agnostic pseudocode for the `calculate_macd` static method within the `FeatureEngineer` class.

## 1. Method Definition

```
FUNCTION calculate_macd(data, fast_window, slow_window, signal_window)
```

### **Parameters:**

-   `data` (DataFrame): A data structure containing time-series data, which must include a 'close' column with numerical price values.
-   `fast_window` (Integer): The time period for the fast Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Default is 12.
-   `slow_window` (Integer): The time period for the slow Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Default is 26.
-   `signal_window` (Integer): The time period for the signal line EMA. Default is 9.

### **Returns:**

-   A tuple containing two Series objects:
    1.  `macd_line` (Series): The calculated MACD line.
    2.  `signal_line` (Series): The calculated signal line.

## 2. Core Logic

```
BEGIN FUNCTION calculate_macd(data, fast_window, slow_window, signal_window)

    -- TDD Anchor: Test for valid input data
    -- TEST: test_calculate_macd_with_valid_data
    -- BEHAVIOR: Should compute MACD and signal lines correctly for a standard DataFrame.
    -- SETUP: Create a sample DataFrame with a 'close' column containing numeric data.
    -- ACTION: Call calculate_macd with standard window parameters (12, 26, 9).
    -- ASSERT: The returned macd_line and signal_line are Series of the correct length.
    -- ASSERT: The initial values are null/NaN due to the windowing, and later values are floats.

    -- 1. Calculate the Fast Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    -- The fast EMA responds more quickly to recent price changes.
    fast_ema = CALCULATE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE(data['close'], window=fast_window)

    -- 2. Calculate the Slow Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
    -- The slow EMA is less sensitive to short-term price fluctuations.
    slow_ema = CALCULATE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE(data['close'], window=slow_window)

    -- 3. Calculate the MACD Line
    -- The MACD line is the difference between the fast and slow EMAs.
    -- It highlights momentum and trend direction.
    macd_line = fast_ema - slow_ema

    -- 4. Calculate the Signal Line
    -- The signal line is an EMA of the MACD line itself.
    -- It is used to generate buy/sell signals when it crosses the MACD line.
    signal_line = CALCULATE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE(macd_line, window=signal_window)

    -- TDD Anchor: Test for handling of insufficient data
    -- TEST: test_calculate_macd_with_insufficient_data
    -- BEHAVIOR: Should return Series of NaNs if data length is less than slow_window.
    -- SETUP: Create a DataFrame with fewer rows than slow_window.
    -- ACTION: Call calculate_macd.
    -- ASSERT: The returned macd_line and signal_line should consist entirely of null/NaN values.

    -- TDD Anchor: Test for correct calculation at a specific data point
    -- TEST: test_calculate_macd_specific_value
    -- BEHAVIOR: Should match a manually calculated MACD value.
    -- SETUP: Use a known dataset and calculate the expected MACD and signal value for a specific index.
    -- ACTION: Call calculate_macd on the dataset.
    -- ASSERT: The calculated value at the specific index in both Series matches the pre-computed expected value within a small tolerance.

    -- 5. Return the results
    RETURN (macd_line, signal_line)

END FUNCTION
```

## 3. Helper Function Signature (Assumed)

The core logic assumes the existence of a helper function to calculate the Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

```
FUNCTION CALCULATE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE(data_series, window)
```

### **Parameters:**

-   `data_series` (Series): A Series of numerical data (e.g., closing prices or the MACD line).
-   `window` (Integer): The specified time period for the EMA calculation.

### **Returns:**

-   `ema_series` (Series): A new Series containing the calculated EMA values.

1. BUG #1 : extraction is dropping/ignoring each 2nd line of data in the table - FIXED
2. BUG #2 : escaped DF setup 're substitutions' gens errors on WINDOWS but not LINUX

2. push extracted data into pandas dataframe (DF) - DONE

3. mongodb (or AWS equiv)

4. 1st 300 seconds timeframe of data is where all the large % moves happen
    1. 1st 60 seconds new price is set (no trades possible)
    2. compare to previous days close
    3. compare to 2nd 60 second window
    4. compare to 3rd 60 second window
    5. compare to 4th 60 second window
    6. infer (quickly) 300 second window trend (up/down/flat)
    7. make inference on 5th 60 second window
    8. in 1st 60 seconds of market open...
        - generate 'Hot Open' List
        - cycle every 10 seconds update list
        - save 10 second history update for top 20 symbols
            - data
            - time (10 sec interval)
            - price
            - $ change
            - % Pct change cumulative
            - % change delta between 10 sec windows
        - Hot Open list is key to Early+Fast decision making


5. Micro/Small cap stocks ($1B Mkt cap & below) are not shown soon after open
    1. as some medium/large cap stocks are slow to open & build momentum
    2. their momentum eventually pushes small cap stocks off the ticker data stream
       - mostly due to Yahoo Finance own display logic
    3. even though small cap stock will have a much greater %change & hence trade opportunity

6. command line args

Pandas Hacking notes
===========================

Duplicates in a DataFrame
==========================
#print ( pd.DataFrame( deep_4, columns=['Symbol']) )
#print ( deep_4.sort_values(by=['Pct_change'], ascending=False )[deep_4.duplicated(['Symbol'])] )
#print ( [deep_4.duplicated(['Symbol'])] )      # output is LIST
#print ( deep_4.duplicated(['Symbol']).index.values )         # output is DataFrame
# deep_4.query[( deep_4.Mkt_cap.isna() & deep_4.M_B.isna() ) ]

NaN rows
========
# SAVE: (deep_4[deep_4['Mkt_cap'].isna()]).iloc[:,0:1]    # fina all NaN's and print index + column 1 - (output = DataFrame
# SAVE: (deep_4[deep_4['Mkt_cap'].isna()]).index          # final all NaN's and print index only - (output = a list)
#nan_rows = testdf2[testdf2['Yearly'].isnull()]
#index = list(nan_rows['Symbol'])

User stories are specifically designed for an AI coding system—rather than a human—the stories are highly structured, unambiguous, and include the necessary technical context for automation. 

For AI-driven software development, User story templates explicitly specify:

* Target component(s): Which part of the system is being addressed (e.g., architecture, UI, tests).  
* Inputs and context: What data or conditions are required.  
* Expected outputs or behaviors: What the system should produce or how it should behave.  
* Acceptance criteria: Technical conditions that must be met for the task to be considered complete.  
* Constraints or requirements: Any specific technology or architectural constraints.

Below are five user story templates tailored for an AI coding system, each supporting one of your five critical coding tasks.

**USER STORY TYPE: Architecture**

## **1\. Define and Code Application Architecture**

User Story Template for AI Coding System (Architecture Definition): A100

*Given the following system requirements: \[list key functional and non-functional requirements\],*  
*And the following business goals: \[list primary business objectives\],*  
*When the AI analyzes the requirements and goals,*  
*Then the AI shall define a scalable, modular application architecture including \[list required modules or layers\],*  
*And document the architecture in \[specified format (e.g., UML, Markdown)\],*  
*With acceptance criteria: \[list technical constraints, e.g., supports horizontal scaling, uses microservices, etc.\]*

**USER STORY TYPE: Tech Stack**

## **2\. Choose the Best Technology Stack Components**

User Story Template for AI Coding System (Tech Stack Selection): S200

*Given the defined application architecture,*  
*And the following technical constraints: \[list constraints, e.g., must use open source, must support cloud deployment\],*  
*When the AI evaluates available technology options,*  
*Then the AI shall select the optimal technology stack for each component,*  
*And justify the selection based on \[criteria, e.g., performance, cost, scalability\],*  
*With acceptance criteria: \[list minimum requirements, e.g., all selected technologies must be actively maintained, documented APIs, etc.\]*

---

**USER STORY TYPE: Code Test**

## **3\. Define and Code Tests**

User Story Template for AI Coding System (Test Definition and Coding): T300

*Given a feature or component specification: \[describe feature or component\],*  
*And the following acceptance criteria: \[list specific behaviors to test\],*  
*When the AI reviews the specification,*  
*Then the AI shall generate automated test cases for \[unit/integration/UI\] testing,*  
*And implement test code in \[specified language or framework\],*  
*With acceptance criteria: \[list coverage requirements, e.g., 90% code coverage, all edge cases covered\]*

---

**USER STORY TYPE: Feature implementation**

## **4\. Define, Code, and Implement Core Features**

User Story Template for AI Coding System (Core Feature Implementation): F400

*Given a feature description: \[describe feature in detail\],*  
*And the following user requirements: \[list user needs and acceptance criteria\],*  
*When the AI analyzes the requirements,*  
*Then the AI shall design and implement the feature in \[specified module or layer\],*  
*And ensure the feature meets all specified acceptance criteria,*  
*With acceptance criteria: \[list technical and functional requirements, e.g., must handle 1000 concurrent users, must be idempotent, etc.\]*

---

**USER STORY TYPE: UI Design and code**

## **5\. Define and Code Application UI**

User Story Template for AI Coding System (UI Implementation): U500

*Given a wireframe or mockup: \[attach or describe UI design\],*  
*And the following user interaction requirements: \[list key user flows and accessibility needs\],*  
*When the AI analyzes the design and requirements,*  
*Then the AI shall generate responsive UI code in \[specified framework, e.g., React, Angular\],*  
*And implement all specified user interactions,*  
*With acceptance criteria: \[list UI standards, e.g., WCAG accessibility, mobile-first design, etc.\]*

These templates are designed to be parsed and acted upon by an AI coding system, providing the structure and detail needed for automation, while still being clear and actionable for your PRD

**User Story Granularity and Structure**

To maintain clarity and manageability, user stories will be organized hierarchically under Epics.

**EPIC**

* **Epic Type ID:** A100, S200, T300, F400, U500  
  * See details in User Story Summary Table

* **Epic Definition**: Each primary stage of the Quant Workflow (from Framework A) will constitute a high-level Epic.

* **Epic ID:**  EPIC-\[ WORKFLOW\_STAGE\_CODE\]-\[SEQ\] (e.g. EPIC-DATA-001 ,  EPIC MODEL-001 )

* **Epic Name**: Descriptive title, e.g., "Automated Global Market Data Acquisition and Feature Engineering," "AI-Driven Strategy Discovery and Robust Backtesting."

* **Description**: Briefly outline the overall goal of the Epic and its contribution to the AI Quant system.

* **Associated Research Report Sections**: List relevant chapters or themes from The Research Report

**USER STORY**

* **User Story Type ID:** A100, S200, T300, F400, U500  
  * See details in User Story Summary Table

* **User Story Standard Format**: User Story ID  
  * US-\[WORKFLOW\_STAGE\_CODE\]-\[SEQ\] (e.g., As a (Role/Persona):

* **System Personas**: US-DATA-001  
  * ( AI\_Quant\_System , AI\_Data\_Pipeline\_Module , AI\_Modeling\_Engine , AI\_Execution\_Agent , AI\_Risk\_Control\_Module , AI\_Compliance\_Module )   
  * These represent different internal components or facets of the AI system itself. 

* **Human User Personas**: Quantitative\_Strategist\_User , Portfolio\_Manager\_User , Risk\_Manager\_User , Compliance\_Officer\_User , System\_Administrator\_User . 

* These represent the humans who will interact with, configure, or oversee the AI system. I want to (Goal/Action): Clearly and concisely describe the specific functionality the AI system should perform or enable. The action should be specific and testable.

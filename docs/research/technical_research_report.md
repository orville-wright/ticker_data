# Technical Research Report: AI-Powered Stock Trend Prediction Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines the technical research conducted for the development of an AI-powered platform to predict stock market trends. The research focused on four key areas: data sources, model architectures, sentiment analysis techniques, and feature engineering. 

Following a multi-path analysis, the **Industry Standard Path** is recommended as the optimal approach. This path provides a robust and reliable foundation with a manageable level of complexity, leveraging well-established technologies like LSTMs and BERT. This approach ensures a strong starting point, with opportunities to integrate more innovative techniques in future iterations.

## 2. Data Sources

### 2.1. Recommended: Alpha Vantage (Historical Data)

*   **Analysis:** Alpha Vantage offers a comprehensive range of historical stock data, including daily open, high, low, close, and volume. It is widely used and has extensive documentation.
*   **Data Quality & Reliability:** The data is generally considered reliable for retail investor purposes.
*   **Cost:** It offers a generous free tier (with rate limits) and affordable premium plans starting around $50/month, making it suitable for initial development and scaling.
*   **Limitations:** The free tier has strict rate limits, and even premium tiers have limitations that may affect high-frequency trading applications, though this is not a primary goal.

### 2.2. Recommended: Twitter/X API (Social Media Sentiment)

*   **Analysis:** The official Twitter/X API is the most reliable source for real-time social media data. It provides access to a massive stream of public discourse on stocks.
*   **Data Quality & Reliability:** Data is high-quality and real-time.
*   **Cost:** The cost structure is tiered. While there is a free tier for basic access, production-level use will require a paid plan, which can be a significant cost factor to consider.
*   **Limitations:** Access to the full firehose of data is expensive. The API has rate limits and a complex set of access rules.

### 2.3. Alternative Options

*   **Innovative Path:**
    *   **Polygon.io/Intrinio:** Offer higher-frequency data and more advanced datasets (e.g., Level 2 order book data) but at a higher cost.
    *   **Utradea API:** A specialized service that pre-processes sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, and StockTwits, potentially simplifying the sentiment analysis pipeline.
*   **Simplicity-First Path:**
    *   **yfinance:** A free Python library that scrapes data from Yahoo Finance. It's excellent for prototyping but may not be reliable enough for a production system.
    *   **Reddit API:** Can be used to scrape data from relevant subreddits (e.g., r/wallstreetbets).

## 3. Model Architectures

### 3.1. Recommended: LSTM (Time-Series Prediction)

*   **Justification:** Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are well-suited for time-series forecasting. They are capable of learning long-term dependencies and have been successfully applied to stock market prediction in numerous studies. They represent a robust and well-understood choice.
*   **Implementation:** Can be implemented using either TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

### 3.2. Recommended: BERT (Sentiment Analysis)

*   **Justification:** Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a powerful language model that can understand the context of text. It significantly outperforms traditional lexicon-based methods. Using a pre-trained BERT model and fine-tuning it on a financial text dataset will provide high-accuracy sentiment analysis.
*   **Implementation:** The Hugging Face Transformers library provides easy-to-use implementations of BERT for both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### 3.3. Alternative Options

*   **Innovative Path:**
    *   **Transformer for Time-Series:** Transformer models, with their attention mechanism, can potentially capture more complex patterns in financial data than LSTMs.
    *   **FinBERT:** A version of BERT pre-trained specifically on financial text, which could offer higher accuracy for sentiment analysis out-of-the-box.
*   **Simplicity-First Path:**
    *   **GRU:** Gated Recurrent Units are a simpler alternative to LSTMs that often perform comparably and train faster.
    *   **VADER (Lexicon-based):** A simple, rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is very fast and requires no model training, making it ideal for a quick prototype.

## 4. Sentiment Analysis Techniques

### 4.1. Pre-processing Steps

1.  **Data Cleaning:** Remove URLs, user mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
2.  **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words or sub-words.
3.  **Lowercasing:** Convert all text to lowercase.
4.  **Stop Word Removal:** Remove common words (e.g., "the", "a", "is") that do not carry significant sentiment.

### 4.2. Sentiment Scoring

*   **Methodology:** A model-based approach using the recommended BERT model. The model will classify each piece of text (e.g., a tweet) into categories such as "positive," "negative," or "neutral," and can also provide a confidence score.

### 4.3. Sentiment Aggregation

*   **Strategy:** For each stock ticker, aggregate the sentiment scores over a specific time period (e.g., daily). This can be a simple average of the sentiment scores or a more complex weighted average that considers factors like user influence (e.g., follower count) or post engagement (e.g., likes, retweets). The result will be a daily sentiment signal for each stock.

## 5. Feature Engineering

### 5.1. Proposed Features

*   **Technical Indicators:**
    *   **Moving Averages (Simple and Exponential):** To smooth out price data and identify trends.
    *   **Relative Strength Index (RSI):** To identify overbought or oversold conditions.
    *   **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):** To reveal changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend.
    *   **Bollinger Bands:** To measure market volatility.
*   **Sentiment Features:**
    *   **Aggregated Daily Sentiment Score:** The primary sentiment signal derived from social media.
    *   **Sentiment Momentum:** The rate of change of the sentiment score.
*   **Time-based Features:**
    *   Day of the week, month, quarter.

This set of features provides a solid foundation for the prediction model, combining traditional technical analysis with modern sentiment analysis.

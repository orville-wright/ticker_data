# Devil's Advocate Critique-- Revised System Architecture

**Report Date--** 2025-06-30
**Subject--** [`docs/architecture/system_architecture.md`](docs/architecture/system_architecture.md)

## Executive Summary

The proposed shift to a granular, orchestrated job pipeline (`IngestionJob` -> `ProcessingJob` -> `PredictionJob`) is a positive evolution from the previous monolithic design. It correctly identifies the need for separation of concerns. However, the high-level proposal dangerously overlooks the fundamental complexities of building a robust, resilient, and scalable data pipeline.

The architecture, as it stands, replaces one large black box with three smaller ones connected by flimsy, undefined strings. It lacks critical details regarding failure handling, data transfer, model lifecycle management, and performance monitoring, introducing significant risks of data inconsistency, model drift, and scalability bottlenecks. This critique dissects these weaknesses and proposes more resilient, production-ready solutions.

## 1. Job Orchestration and Failure Handling

**The Architectural Gap--** The diagram and description state that jobs are "chained" and one job "triggers" the next upon "successful completion." This is a vague and optimistic description of a complex workflow.

**The Critique--** This design introduces multiple points of failure without a corresponding fault-tolerance strategy. What constitutes a "failure"? What happens if the `ProcessingJob` fails for 3 out of 10,000 stocks? Does the entire pipeline halt? Does the `PredictionJob` run on a partially complete, inconsistent dataset from the previous day? The architecture document provides no answers, leading to several likely failure modes--
-   **Data Inconsistency--** A failure in an intermediate job can leave the database in a corrupt state, with fresh raw data for some stocks but stale, unprocessed features for others. This makes all downstream predictions unreliable.
-   **Silent Failures--** Without explicit state management and alerting, a non-catastrophic failure (e.g., a rate limit error from an API for a single stock) could go unnoticed, silently degrading the quality of the data pipeline.
-   **No Recovery Path--** The architecture lacks any mechanism for retries, dead-letter queues, or manual intervention. A transient network error could poison the entire day's prediction run with no clear path to recovery.

**Recommendations--**
-   **Implement a State Machine--** Treat each daily pipeline run as a stateful process. The `Scheduler/Orchestrator` should not just "trigger" jobs but actively manage the state of each task (e.g., `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILED`). A failure in any job transitions the task to a `FAILED` state.
-   **Define Transactional Boundaries--** The pipeline for a given stock should be atomic. Either it completes successfully across all three stages, or it is rolled back/marked as failed. The `PredictionJob` should only run on data that has been explicitly marked as successfully processed.
-   **Introduce Robust Alerting and Retries--** Integrate an alerting mechanism (e.g., email, Slack) for any job failure. Implement a configurable retry policy (e.g., exponential backoff) for transient errors within the job logic itself, as was previously done for the `TwitterClient` based on prior feedback.

## 2. Data Handoff Between Jobs

**The Architectural Gap--** The document does not specify the mechanism for passing data between the `IngestionJob`, `ProcessingJob`, and `PredictionJob`.

**The Critique--** The method of data handoff is a cornerstone of pipeline scalability and performance, yet it is completely undefined.
-   **If passing data in-memory** (e.g., via Celery's message broker), the system will not scale. Large Pandas DataFrames for thousands of stocks will quickly overwhelm the broker's memory limits, leading to crashes and lost data.
-   **If passing data via the filesystem** (writing and reading CSV/Parquet files), the architecture needs to define a strict protocol for managing these temporary artifacts, including naming conventions, cleanup, and handling of I/O errors. This can become an operational bottleneck.

**Recommendations--**
-   **Decouple with a Data Store--** Do not pass data directly. Use the database or a dedicated storage layer (like an S3 bucket) as the intermediary.
    -   `IngestionJob` writes raw data to a "raw_data" table or a `raw-data/` prefix in S3.
    -   Upon completion, it passes a *reference* (e.g., a list of primary keys or file paths) to the `ProcessingJob`.
    -   `ProcessingJob` reads the raw data, processes it, and writes the results to a "features" table or a `processed-data/` prefix in S3.
-   This approach decouples the jobs, allows them to be run independently for debugging, and scales far more effectively.

## 3. Model Management and Versioning

**The Architectural Gap--** The `PredictionJob` and `ProcessingJob` load the `PredictionModel` and `SentimentAnalysisModel` respectively. The mechanism for updating these models is not defined.

**The Critique--** The architecture treats the ML models as static files deployed with the code. This is a naive approach that completely ignores the lifecycle of machine learning models. How is a new, retrained model promoted to production without downtime? How do you roll back a poorly performing model? Without a clear process, model updates become a high-risk, manual activity that invites human error and can lead to using stale or incorrect models.

**Recommendations--**
-   **Implement a Model Registry--** Integrate a model registry. This could be a dedicated tool like MLflow or a simple, disciplined approach using a versioned S3 bucket and a database table that maps model names to versions and file paths (e.g., `s3://models/prediction-model/v1.2/model.h5`).
-   **Decouple Model Deployment from Code Deployment--** The `PredictionJob` should not load a model from a hardcoded path. Instead, it should query the registry for the latest model version tagged as "production." This allows data scientists to update models independently of engineering code releases.

## 4. Scalability of the Scheduler

**The Architectural Gap--** The document suggests "Celery with a message broker" as a solution for a distributed setup but does not elaborate on the implications.

**The Critique--** Recommending "Celery" is not an architecture; it's a technology choice that papers over immense operational complexity. As the number of stocks grows, the orchestrator becomes a significant bottleneck and single point of failure. Managing a large-scale Celery deployment involves configuring, monitoring, and scaling workers, managing the message broker, and debugging complex distributed state issues. These are non-trivial engineering challenges that are completely ignored.

**Recommendations--**
-   **Acknowledge Complexity--** The architecture should explicitly acknowledge the operational cost of a distributed task queue.
-   **Consider Data-Aware Orchestrators--** For a system this data-centric, tools like **Apache Airflow** or **Dagster** are superior choices to vanilla Celery. They are designed specifically for orchestrating complex data pipelines (DAGs), providing better UIs for monitoring, native support for data handoffs, and more robust state management capabilities out of thethe-box.

## 5. Lack of a Feedback Loop

**The Architectural Gap--** The data flow is strictly linear. There is no described mechanism for monitoring the performance of the live prediction model or using that information to improve the system.

**The Critique--** The architecture describes a "fire-and-forget" system. It assumes that a model, once deployed, remains effective indefinitely. In the volatile domain of financial markets, this is a fatal flaw. Model performance will degradeâ€”this is a certainty. Without a feedback loop, the platform will be flying blind, producing increasingly unreliable signals with no automated way to detect or correct the decay. This directly contradicts the project's primary success criterion of maintaining a high Sharpe Ratio over a benchmark, as defined in [`docs/test-plans/master_acceptance_test_plan.md`](docs/test-plans/master_acceptance_test_plan.md:1).

**Recommendations--**
-   **Architect a Monitoring and Retraining Loop--**
    1.  **Performance Monitoring Job--** Create a new scheduled job that runs weekly or monthly. This job compares the predictions made by the live model against actual market outcomes to calculate metrics like directional accuracy and, most importantly, the ongoing Sharpe Ratio.
    2.  **Performance Threshold & Alerting--** Define a performance threshold (e.g., Sharpe Ratio drops below 1.1x the benchmark). If this threshold is breached, an alert must be sent to the development team.
    3.  **Automated Retraining Pipeline--** Create a `RetrainingJob` that can be triggered (either manually on alert or automatically) to retrain the `PredictionModel` on the latest available data. The newly trained model should be automatically evaluated against the validation set, and if its performance exceeds the current production model, it should be uploaded to the model registry and tagged for promotion. This closes the loop and creates a system capable of adapting and surviving in a dynamic environment.

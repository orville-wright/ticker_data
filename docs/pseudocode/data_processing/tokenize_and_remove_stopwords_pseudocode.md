# Pseudocode: TweetProcessor.tokenize_and_remove_stopwords

This document outlines the detailed, language-agnostic pseudocode for the `tokenize_and_remove_stopwords` static method within the `TweetProcessor` class.

## 1. Method Definition

```pseudocode
CLASS TweetProcessor

    -- Static method to tokenize text and filter out stop words.
    STATIC FUNCTION tokenize_and_remove_stopwords(text AS STRING, stopwords AS SET_OF_STRINGS) RETURNS LIST_OF_STRINGS

```

## 2. TDD Anchors

The following tests will be used to verify the implementation.

```pseudocode
-- TEST: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_happy_path
-- BEHAVIOR: Should correctly split a simple sentence into tokens and remove the specified stop words.
-- INPUT_TEXT: "this is a great stock"
-- INPUT_STOPWORDS: {"this", "is", "a"}
-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: ["great", "stock"]
-- ASSERT: The returned list equals the expected list of meaningful tokens.

-- TEST: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_no_stopwords_present
-- BEHAVIOR: Should return all tokens if none of them are in the stop words set.
-- INPUT_TEXT: "buy and hold strong"
-- INPUT_STOPWORDS: {"the", "a", "an"}
-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: ["buy", "and", "hold", "strong"]
-- ASSERT: The returned list contains all original tokens.

-- TEST: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_all_stopwords
-- BEHAVIOR: Should return an empty list if all words in the text are stop words.
-- INPUT_TEXT: "this is it"
-- INPUT_STOPWORDS: {"this", "is", "it"}
-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: []
-- ASSERT: The returned list is empty.

-- TEST: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_empty_string
-- BEHAVIOR: Should handle an empty input string gracefully.
-- INPUT_TEXT: ""
-- INPUT_STOPWORDS: {"a", "the", "is"}
-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: []
-- ASSERT: The returned list is empty.

-- TEST: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_empty_stopwords_set
-- BEHAVIOR: Should return all tokens if the stop words set is empty.
-- INPUT_TEXT: "another important message"
-- INPUT_STOPWORDS: {}
-- EXPECTED_OUTPUT: ["another", "important", "message"]
-- ASSERT: The returned list contains all original tokens.
```

## 3. Logic

The core logic involves splitting the input string into words and filtering them based on the provided set of stop words.

```pseudocode
CLASS TweetProcessor

    STATIC FUNCTION tokenize_and_remove_stopwords(text AS STRING, stopwords AS SET_OF_STRINGS) RETURNS LIST_OF_STRINGS
        -- TDD Anchor: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_happy_path
        -- TDD Anchor: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_empty_string

        -- 1. Initialize an empty list to hold the resulting tokens.
        meaningful_tokens = NEW LIST_OF_STRINGS

        -- 2. Handle edge case of empty or null input text.
        IF text IS NULL OR text IS EMPTY THEN
            RETURN meaningful_tokens
        END IF

        -- 3. Tokenize the input string by splitting it by spaces.
        --    This assumes the text has been cleaned and is in a simple format.
        all_tokens = text.split(" ")

        -- 4. Iterate through each token from the tokenized list.
        FOR EACH token IN all_tokens
            -- TDD Anchor: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_no_stopwords_present
            -- TDD Anchor: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_all_stopwords
            -- TDD Anchor: test_tokenize_and_remove_stopwords_empty_stopwords_set

            -- 5. Check if the token is NOT present in the stopwords set.
            --    Comparison should be case-insensitive if not already handled by a cleaning step.
            --    Assuming the cleaning step has already converted text to lowercase.
            IF token IS NOT IN stopwords THEN
                -- 6. If it's a meaningful word, add it to the list.
                APPEND token TO meaningful_tokens
            END IF
        END FOR

        -- 7. Return the list of meaningful tokens.
        RETURN meaningful_tokens

    END FUNCTION

END CLASS

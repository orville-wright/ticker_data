# System Integration Report

## 1. Introduction

This report details the integration of the `AlphaVantageClient` and `TwitterClient` modules into a cohesive data ingestion pipeline. The integration was performed according to the specifications outlined in [`docs/specifications/1_data_ingestion_spec.md`](docs/specifications/1_data_ingestion_spec.md) and the logic defined in [`docs/pseudocode/data_ingestion/run_ingestion_pipeline.md`](docs/pseudocode/data_ingestion/run_ingestion_pipeline.md).

The primary outcome is the creation of the `data_ingestion/pipeline.py` module, which orchestrates concurrent data fetching from both Alpha Vantage and the Twitter/X API.

## 2. Integration Steps Performed

The integration process involved the following key steps:

### 2.1. Component Analysis

-   **[`data_ingestion/alpha_vantage_client.py`](data_ingestion/alpha_vantage_client.py):** The `AlphaVantageClient` was analyzed to understand its `fetch_daily_time_series` method. It was confirmed that the method accepts a stock symbol and returns a dictionary of price data. The client includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
-   **[`data_ingestion/twitter_client.py`](data_ingestion/twitter_client.py):** The `TwitterClient` was analyzed to understand its `search_tweets` method. It was confirmed that the method accepts a ticker symbol, constructs the appropriate query, and returns a list of tweet data. This client also has built-in resiliency.

### 2.2. System Assembly

-   A new file, [`data_ingestion/pipeline.py`](data_ingestion/pipeline.py), was created to house the integration logic, keeping it separate from the individual client implementations.
-   The `AlphaVantageClient` and `TwitterClient` classes were imported into the new `pipeline` module.

### 2.3. Implementation of `fetch_data_for_stock`

-   A helper function, `fetch_data_for_stock`, was implemented as defined in the pseudocode.
-   This function encapsulates the logic for fetching data for a *single* stock from both clients.
-   It includes a `try...except` block to gracefully handle any exceptions that might occur during the API calls for an individual stock, preventing one failure from halting the entire pipeline.
-   The function returns a structured dictionary containing the symbol, the fetched data, and an error status.

### 2.4. Implementation of `run_ingestion_pipeline`

-   The main orchestration function, `run_ingestion_pipeline`, was implemented.
-   It utilizes Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to manage a pool of worker threads, enabling parallel execution of the `fetch_data_for_stock` function for multiple stocks.
-   It iterates through the completed futures, aggregates the results, and handles successes and failures appropriately.
-   For failed fetches, it logs an error and populates the corresponding entry in the final dictionary with empty data structures (`{}` for price data, `[]` for tweet data), ensuring a consistent output structure.

## 3. Configuration Changes

No configuration files were modified during this integration. The pipeline is designed to receive initialized instances of the clients, making it flexible and decoupled from the configuration process.

## 4. Integration Issues and Resolutions

No significant integration issues were encountered. The specifications and pseudocode were clear and provided a solid foundation for the implementation. The client modules were well-defined, which made them easy to integrate.

## 5. Overall Status

**Status: Complete**

The system integration was successful. The `AlphaVantageClient` and `TwitterClient` are now fully integrated into a concurrent data ingestion pipeline within the `data_ingestion/pipeline.py` module. The system can now be used to fetch stock and tweet data for a list of symbols in a parallel and resilient manner, ready for the next phase of data processing.

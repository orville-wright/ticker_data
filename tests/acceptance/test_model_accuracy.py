# This is a placeholder for the actual model validation script.
# In a real-world scenario, this would be a complex script that--
# 1. Connects to a data source (like a versioned S3 bucket).
# 2. Implements the Walk-Forward Validation logic described in the test plan.
# 3. Trains the model, makes predictions, and simulates a portfolio.
# 4. Fetches benchmark data (e.g., for SPY).
# 5. Calculates Sharpe Ratios for both the model portfolio and the benchmark.
# 6. Is likely run as a scheduled job or via a CI/CD pipeline, not with pytest directly.

# For the purpose of having an AI-verifiable test, we simulate the outcome.
